# React Coding Exercise
This exercise has two parts -
1. Create a general-purpose tab component
2. Create a to-do list, with the "add todo" form in one tab, and the list displayed on another.


## Notes
1. Looking up help online is okay, but full screen sharing must be on. Only static resources may be consulted. No help should be sought live, from another person online. **NO** artificial intelligence tools (such as Github Copilot) may be used.
2. You can implement the solution in either JavaScript or TypeScript.
3. Some states are better passed as props, others might be better to put in the global state. Use your best judgment.
